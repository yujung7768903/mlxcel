# Technical Report: PR #1893 — Runtime observation and Activity

**Date**: 2026-09-14

**Status**: Implementation and scoped production acceptance complete; native hidden-host performance and final integrated manual acceptance remain outstanding.

**Languages**: Rust, TypeScript/React, JavaScript, OpenAPI/JSON Schema

**Risk level**: Medium

## Executive summary

Issue #1847 adds the Activity screen to epic #1834 using the published npm `@lablup/ui-common@0.1.0-alpha.19` adapters. Existing provider, lifecycle, slot and metrics owners remain authoritative. The UI distinguishes unavailable values from measured zero and does not initialize MLX, trigger autoload or add GPU sampling.

## Architecture and behavior

The canonical runtime projection moved from `webui/api.rs` into `webui/runtime.rs`, with required typed `slots` and strict whole-response fixtures. Ready provider observation clones a loaded state only when the visible catalog identity/revision still matches; CPU counters and a bounded redacted slot registry are the only new reads. `--metrics` and `--slots` remain effective. Requests, provider-lifetime completed counters and cache metrics carry units, scope, timestamps and source/window explanations. General effective parallelism, process/allocator/device memory, exact KV bytes, TTFT and interval decode rate remain N/A when no cheap authoritative source is available.

The merged #1800 source tracks current context occupancy including accepted decode tokens. Activity uses that counter without adding decoded tokens twice, and does not divide by unknown/zero context capacity. Shared-pool geometry remains separately nullable. The later #1815 worker-published width-one/context authority is consumed, not reconstructed from configured limits.

Activity shows active and terminal operations, explicit cancellation acknowledgement, typed failures, selected runtime, partial slot warnings, sanitized export and a lazy discrete history plot. One shared synchronizer owns two-second visible observation, ten-second snapshot timeout, hidden-tab request/stream/timer teardown and reconnect. Provider model selection now calls observation-only `selectionChanged()`, preserving in-flight inference; logout still aborts the complete session. A complete unfiltered catalog clears a removed selected model, with generation and page consistency checks.

The selected-model history is memory-only, five minutes/150 two-second buckets. Terminal operation retention is capped at 200 for one hour, including repeated same-sequence snapshots; active operations are never silently discarded. Diagnostics use a strict allowlist rather than attempting to redact arbitrary free text, excluding credentials, private paths, prompts, output, model identifiers and operation errors.

## Independent review corrections

- Correctness review found the new observation-only cancellation seam was not wired by the real provider. Ownership was explicitly transferred from the later Chat unit; provider wiring and a real shared-client stream-preservation regression now cover selection and logout.
- Security/performance review found terminal TTL bypass during snapshot ingestion, cross-model contamination of the selected history ring, and a hidden warning for available-but-truncated slots. All were corrected with targeted regressions and rereviewed with no remaining findings.
- Chat separately owns the pre-existing abort-reader rejection race fix; Activity does not duplicate it or infer successful inference completion from a resolved transport promise.

## Executed validation

Historical pre-integration implementation source: `51fe6579958718b72f1a7a89bbeb29d2c4cb886d`. Subsequent report/harness-only changes do not alter the runtime or frontend bundle.

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Frontend unit suite | 94 passed, 13 files |
| Strict TypeScript and ESLint | Passed |
| CPU-only runtime projection selectors | 6 passed |
| Revision/LRU/lease observation regression | 1 passed |
| Scoped library/tests Clippy | Passed |
| Canonical fixtures, DTO drift and schema strictness | 48 passed |
| Compatibility/version/kernel structural gates, fmt/diff | Passed |
| Deterministic embedded bundle rebuild and verify | Passed; digest `6a887a0b8fb8c4ab7f61c783ed52d44de16160fc985bd76e9ede3c5dea898a57` |
| Local production browser, real model and GPU/performance | Not executed by this unit |

The initial runtime test build had an incorrect fixture-relative include path. A subsequent whole-ready JSON test exposed integer `0` versus the producer's f64 `0.0` representation in the authored fixture; only fixture representation was corrected, without weakening whole-response assertions or modifying numerical inference code. Original logs remain available under `/tmp/1847-runtime-*`. Initial timer cleanup tests also exposed a retained timeout; immediate teardown now clears it.

Hosted source `51fe6579` passed all executable checks. The WebUI job `103992971327` in run `34849305758` actually executed 94 unit tests, 22 browser cases (including both new Activity cases), and deterministic bundle verification successfully. Skipped compile/runtime steps are not claimed as passes. The current GB10 runner state is not a blanket waiver for actual failures.

## Remaining acceptance and integration

`webui/scripts/activity-performance.mjs` prepares five alternating-order UI-off/treatment pairs for one visible, two visible and actually hidden headed-browser clients. It requires native backend `timings.predicted_per_second`, records median paired degradation and noise, and flags >2% degradation or >5% baseline CV for investigation. `activity-slots.mjs` captures an actual long chat stream with before/runtime/after native slot samples, strips all text, bounds time and leaves the result explicitly requiring comparison. These scripts are prepared and syntax/lint-checked, not measured acceptance results.

Central integration order is #1846 → #1847 → #1844 → #1845. The Settings integration described below is complete. Root-owned full/real-model/production-CSP/performance acceptance remains outstanding. Safari/VoiceOver/native 200% checks are explicitly deferred to the final integrated manual session, not passed. No existing user checkpoints were modified or removed.

## September 15 Settings integration

Measured integrated source: `93c825b8a6dc432d8f2427fd1cc8edee1ba2dde0`, based on merged Settings `2a91bf3069fb84fdc729d688baad8747136af252` and the Rustls security update. Runtime metrics and actual effective configuration now share one revision-fenced loaded AppState; CLI override provenance survives. Settings session-fenced operations and Activity observation-only selection both retain their provider regressions. The generated bundle includes both screens, the corrected Field accessible names, and the canonical eight-character Vite asset hashes.

Executed integration gates: 137 frontend tests in 19 files, 14 offline SSE acceptance tests, TypeScript, ESLint, 49 canonical fixtures/schema checks, six CPU runtime tests and one revision/LRU observation test, formatting/diff checks, and deterministic bundle verification all passed. Integrated bundle digest: `d9102d2559e51de2f16dc2c9a409c6ad5860c65157fb10f8ba190181a8a83dc8`. Previous hosted browser evidence above applies only to its recorded historical source; no new local browser, full workspace, real-model or performance pass is claimed here.

The real slots harness now validates bounded UTF-8 SSE frames, rejects explicit errors, malformed/truncated responses and post-finish choices, and requires a successful finish reason followed by `[DONE]`. It retains no generated text. An independent read-only correctness/security review verified the integration seams and identified the post-finish acceptance gap; it was fixed with regressions and rereviewed with no remaining findings. The maintainer deferred GPU timeout root-cause diagnosis, not correctness assertions or failed acceptance results. Native Safari/VoiceOver/200% remains deferred to the final integrated session.

## Actual-host follow-up and concise presentation

Root-owned acceptance on the preceding `93c825b8` runtime passed two production browser cases with CSP checks and actual native/runtime slot comparison: four captured samples, including three stable comparable brackets at an 8192-token context, with graceful server exit. The subsequent headed performance attempt failed before the first visible treatment. Its only samples were warmup and one UI-off request; these do not establish UI overhead. The original failed attempt remains preserved.

The CPU-only desktop diagnostic then found zero layout and visual viewport dimensions even on a blank headed page after native bounds changes; headed screenshot capture also hung. Full headless Chromium had usable geometry, but native minimize and foreground-tab changes did not change `document.hidden`. The acceptance helper now preflights geometry and real visibility before any warmup. Its opt-in visible-only headless diagnostic always reports incomplete, with native hidden not run; per-condition regressions are still flagged. Native hidden overhead remains a required integrated #1848 interactive-host acceptance item, not passed or waived.

Root screenshot review also found an excessively long default list of unavailable metrics. The default now presents available primary request counters (including measured zero) and slots, with explicit unavailable counts. All measurements, individual reasons, scopes and provenance remain available in a native keyboard-accessible disclosure; labels are human-readable in English and Korean and cumulative counters are identified as totals. No backend or shared design tokens changed. Independent read-only review is clear. The updated frontend passed 139 tests and 17 offline acceptance-policy/SSE tests, TypeScript and ESLint. New actual browser and visible-only paired measurements remain root-owned pending work; earlier screenshots are not claimed to validate this changed layout.

## Headless diagnostic infrastructure correction

Root validation of `34fffa69` passed the production build, 23 browser tests, two production CSP/axe/layout cases and actual slots comparison again. Root visually reviewed and accepted the concise runtime presentation. No UI regression was identified. The separate full-Chromium headless performance attempt crashed with SIGBUS during context replacement before any sample, with display-link and notification-center failures in the process log; it supplies no throughput evidence. That failure is preserved independently of the passing UI checks.

Only the diagnostic harness now uses default Chromium headless shell and skips every native-window/CDP call in headless mode. Actual visibility assertions remain, visible-only output remains incomplete, and native hidden overhead stays required in #1848. No runtime/frontend source or UI asset bytes changed in this correction.

## Final visible-only measured evidence

The final helper source `e83508b083696657cdce36568c8ba3cd94bbfaf3` completed the visible-only headless diagnostic against the production binary built from `34fffa69adafccb7eb085cb1ce4d35b7fb50ee9c` (SHA-256 `bfdaf8f5d3e5ae020bf00de726a30d9e3b94eb9f01784506782f171746400010`). UI, backend and embedded asset bytes were unchanged between those commits. The existing read-only Llama 3.1 8B Instruct 4-bit checkpoint was copied into an isolated owned cache; measurement used the same loaded model, request and hardware with five alternating-order off/treatment pairs per visible condition. All 21 requests, including one warmup, produced 256 measured tokens.

| Visible headless condition | Paired runs | Median decode degradation | Baseline coefficient of variation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| One client | 5 | -0.069808% | 0.271240% |
| Two clients | 5 | +0.104932% | 0.139325% |

Both visible conditions met the 2% degradation and 5% baseline-noise targets. The small negative value does not establish a speedup. Actual visibility was checked without synthetic events. Overall performance status remains **incomplete**, and native hidden is **not run**; these limited headless measurements are not full performance acceptance. Explicit unload observed worker exit and the owned server exited normally with code 0. Original failed headed/full-Chromium attempts remain retained, not overwritten by this successful limited capture.

Root also completed 23 browser cases, two actual production CSP/axe/layout cases and real native/runtime slots comparison, and accepted the concise actual layout at `34fffa69`. The remaining required acceptance belongs to integrated #1848: native hidden-host overhead on a functioning interactive host and the deferred Safari/VoiceOver/native 200% session. This report does not mark the epic complete or imply those checks passed. Final hosted CI and central merge remain root-owned.
