//! Adaptive MTP enable/decline policy (issue #333).
//!
//! ## What this replaces
//!
//! Before #333 the singleton (B=1) MTP burst was gated by a purely static
//! per-hardware rule ([`super::speculative_burst::mtp_b1_default`], issue
//! #165, revised by #1217): non-batchable 12B targets default on everywhere,
//! batch-capable 31B targets default on from Apple GPU generation 15. Those
//! static gates are correct for the
//! pairings they were measured on, but they leave performance on the table
//! when a new (target, drafter, hardware) pairing is favorable yet the static
//! rule declines it, and they keep running MTP on a pairing that turns out
//! unfavorable.
//!
//! ## What it does instead
//!
//! This module profiles the first few B=1 burst requests of a
//! (target, drafter, hardware) pairing and settles to a data-driven verdict:
//!
//! - **Profiling.** While profiling, [`MtpPolicy::should_attempt_b1`] forces
//!   MTP on so the burst path runs and reports its acceptance + latency split
//!   ([`MtpBurstProfile`]). This is the only way to discover a pairing the
//!   static gate would have declined. The cost is bounded to
//!   [`PROFILE_SAMPLE_TARGET`] qualifying requests and is paid once: the
//!   verdict is persisted, so a restart on the same pairing skips profiling.
//! - **Settling.** After [`PROFILE_SAMPLE_TARGET`] qualifying samples the
//!   accumulated profile yields an optimistic speedup estimate (see
//!   [`estimate_speedup`]). A clearly favorable estimate enables MTP, a clearly
//!   unfavorable one declines it (both overriding the static gate), and an
//!   ambiguous estimate falls back to the static per-hardware default (which
//!   already encodes the M1-Ultra-vs-M5 reality).
//! - **Manual override.** `MLXCEL_ENABLE_MTP_B1` still pins the decision in
//!   both directions; when it is set the policy never profiles. Setting
//!   `MLXCEL_MTP_ADAPTIVE=0` disables the adaptive path entirely and restores
//!   the pre-#333 pure-static gates.
//!
//! ## Exactness is untouched
//!
//! MTP speculative decode is mathematically exact: the drafter proposes, the
//! target verifies, and accepted tokens are exactly what the target would have
//! produced. At `temperature == 0` MTP output is byte-identical to classic
//! decode. This policy only decides *when* to run MTP; it never touches the
//! tokens the burst emits, so the exactness guarantee is preserved.
//!
//! ## What is persisted
//!
//! Only a coarse per-pairing hint: the enable/decline verdict, the coarse
//! measured acceptance rate, and the sample count. No prompt data, no token
//! ids, nothing request-identifying. Hints live one file per pairing under
//! `${MLXCEL_CACHE_DIR:-$HOME/.cache/mlxcel}/mtp-policy/<key-hash>.json`.
