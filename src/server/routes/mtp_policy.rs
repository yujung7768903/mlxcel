//! Adaptive MTP policy read endpoint (issue #1257).
//!
//! `GET /v1/internal/mtp-policy` reports the adaptive B=1 MTP policy's state
//! for the pairing this server is running: whether the verdict has settled,
//! which way it settled, and how far a profiling window has to go.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The verdict already lived in a per-pairing hint file under
//! `${MLXCEL_CACHE_DIR:-$HOME/.cache/mlxcel}/mtp-policy/`, and a host
//! application that wanted to show it had no choice but to read that private
//! on-disk format from another process. That coupling breaks silently: the
//! hint format is versioned and free to change in a patch release, and a
//! consumer that stops recognising it degrades to a blank surface neither
//! project detects. This endpoint is the supported alternative, served by the
//! process that owns the decision, over the transport the consumer already
//! uses. The hint files are unchanged and keep working.
//!
//! ## Versioning and compatibility
//!
//! The body carries [`MTP_POLICY_SCHEMA_VERSION`]. Within one schema version
//! the contract is: existing fields keep their names, types, and meanings, and
//! the `state`, `reason`, and `verdict` label sets only grow. New fields may
//! be added, so a consumer must ignore unknown fields and must treat an
//! unrecognised label as "no verdict I can render" rather than as an error.
//! Anything that breaks those promises (a removed or renamed field, a changed
//! meaning, a narrowed label set) bumps `schema_version`. See
//! `docs/mtp-policy-api.md` for the full contract.
//!
//! The endpoint is always mounted, and answers with a well-formed body even
//! when no policy is running, so a consumer polls unconditionally. Gating it
//! behind a flag would reproduce the very failure it exists to remove: a
//! consumer that cannot tell "nothing to report" from "this server does not
//! answer".
