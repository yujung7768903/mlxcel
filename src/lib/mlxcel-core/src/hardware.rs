// The CUDA side of "what machine is this?" lives in [`crate::cuda_arch`] and is
// re-exported here so there is a single hardware-facing module to ask, whether
// the answer comes from `sysctlbyname` on Apple Silicon or from MLX's cached
// CUDA device attributes. It is a separate file because the architecture-list
// parser and its coverage rules carry their own unit tests and would otherwise
// push this module well past the size where it stays readable.
//
// Nothing here feeds [`HardwareCapabilities`]: that struct is built by
// [`detect_hardware`], which runs from [`apply_metal_ops_per_buffer_default`]
// at the very top of `main`, and probing a CUDA device from there would move
// device initialisation ahead of the environment defaults that must be set
// before MLX touches the GPU. The capability probe stays lazy and separate.
