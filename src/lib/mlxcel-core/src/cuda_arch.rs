//! CUDA compute capability: what this binary was compiled for, what it is
//! running on, and whether those two agree (issue #1537).
//!
//! Three values meet here.
//!
//! - The **compiled architecture list** is the `MLX_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` string
//!   that `build.rs` handed to CMake, recorded back into the crate as
//!   `MLXCEL_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` so the binary knows what device code it
//!   actually carries. Empty off CUDA.
//! - The **running compute capability** comes from MLX's own cached device
//!   attributes through the `gpu_compute_capability` bridge function. `None`
//!   on Metal, on a CPU-only build, and on a CUDA build with no usable device.
//! - The **coverage verdict** is the predicate over those two that decides
//!   whether the running device can execute this binary's kernels at all.
//!
//! Until this module existed, mlxcel had no notion of compute capability
//! anywhere in its own code: every architecture decision was delegated to
//! MLX's C++ gates, so a binary whose cubin set did not cover the host failed
//! with an opaque CUDA load error at the first kernel launch rather than
//! saying which architectures it was built for. The published x86_64 release
//! matrix starts at `80`, so a released archive cannot run on a V100 at all,
//! and `build.rs` falls back to `90a` when `nvidia-smi` is missing, which
//! yields a binary that cannot run on its own build host. Both cases are now
//! a named error at device init.
//!
//! This module is plumbing and diagnostics only. Nothing here changes which
//! kernel runs; consumers that act on the capability are separate work.
